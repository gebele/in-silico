    %em Lazy Structure- Activity Relationships
    )
    takes a chemical structure as input and provides predictions for a variety of toxic properties.
    %code lazar
    uses a automated and reproducible 
    %em read across
    procedure to calculate predictions. 
    Rationales for predictions, applicability domain estimations and validation results are presented in a clear graphical interface for the critical examination by toxicological experts.
    %code lazar
    is built on top of the 
    %a{:href => "http://www.opentox.org"} OpenTox
    framework.
